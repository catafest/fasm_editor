# Name: fasm_editor
FASM Editor for fasm programming language in Linux O.S.

# Intro:
Today, October 2, 2020, I launched this simple project for FASM language users who use the Linux operating system.

It doesn't have a high priority for me and I will try to improve it when I can.

Anyone who wants to improve this project or support it is welcome.

# Objectives:
The objectives of this project are:
- creating a functional editor;
- implementation of running and compilation requirements;
- settings specific to the Linux operating system;

# Steps taken so far:
- creating a window in GTK #;
- creating a menu with File Run;
- creating the editing area;
